Title: Robust Score testing in GLMs, by sign-flip contributions 
Author: Livio Finos, Jesse Hemerik and Jelle Goeman with contribution by Vittorio Giatti
Maintainer: Livio Finos <livio.finos@unipd.it>
Description: Provides robust tests for testing in GLMs, by sign-flipping score contributions. The tests are robust against overdispersion, heteroscedasticity and, in some cases, ignored nuisance variables. See Hemerik, Goeman and Finos (2019) <https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03796>.
